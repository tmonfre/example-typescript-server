# Example TypeScript Web Server

This repository is meant to run in conjunction with the [example TypeScript webapp](https://github.com/tmonfre/example-typescript-webapp). Clone the two repositories and put them in the same directory.

Note: the Docker compose file for the project expects the two directories to be called "server" and "webapp"
